      <iframe title="Spotify Embed: TPR" width="300" height="380" allowtransparency="true" style="border: 3px solid #CCC; float: right; margin: 10px;" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/6ImfL6wSxqhYl64AbsaNZX?si=wXMOSyW8RfOI6nsta7KQMw"></iframe>
      <p>I read an article recently from Business Insider that states that people typically find their musical variety slowly fizzle as they age. One paragraph in particular caught my attention:</p>
      <p><figure style="border-left: 5px solid #666; margin: 50px;">
      <blockquote style="font-style: normal; font-size: 12pt; padding: 10px; text-align: left; margin: 0px;">In 2015, the <a href="https://skynetandebert.com/2015/04/22/music-was-better-back-then-when-do-we-stop-keeping-up-with-popular-music/">Skynet & Ebert blog</a> looked at data from US Spotify users and Echo Nest. On average, teen music taste was dominated by popular music, then this steadily dropped until people's tastes "matured" in their early 30s. By age 33, it was more likely they'd never listen to new music again.</blockquote>
      <figcaption style="text-align: left; padding: 10px;">Dodgson, Lindsay. “We Stop Discovering New Music at Age 30, a New Survey Suggests - Here Are the Scientific Reasons Why This Could Be.” Business Insider, Business Insider, 7 June 2018, www.businessinsider.com/why-we-stop-discovering-new-music-around-age-30-2018-6.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Music plays a more important role in life than just its aesthetics.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In an effort to continually expand my own musical horizons I find myself searching for more and more music. Here I will post an artist that catches my ear, deserves more credit than they are receiving, or challenges me to think outside the modern status quo. I hope you will join along in supporting these great artists!</p>
	  <p>Also, if you have a suggestion for the artist of the month or have any music you (or someone you know) created and just want to share it, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and I'll be sure to give it a listen (or at least try to...).</p>
	  <p>This month's artist is one that combines a few of my favorite things all into one: piano, video games, minor keys, and acronyms.</p>
	  <p>TPR, as the artist is called, specializes in melancholy piano tracks from various video games. Most of his repertoire includes Square Enix video games, notably the Final Fantasy series, and does an excellent job of blending his own take on a classic piece. Please, check him out on Spotify if you haven't already.</p>
