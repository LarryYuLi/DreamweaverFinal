      <p>Welcome to David's Music Talk! Here, we discuss a variety of topics that all revolve around music. Whether it's recording techniques that are useful for up-and-comers or it's highlighting an artist's amazing work, all things music can and will be found here.</p>
      <p>Every month we dedicate the monthly artist page to someone who is either new to the industry and deserves some credit or an artist who, despite being a veteran in the music industry, does not recieve the credit they deserve. Be apart of the vote for artist of the month on social media by following our twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DavesRants">*@DavesRants</a> or by liking our page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Davids-Rants-387344198553759/">Facebook</a>!</p>

<p>Hello, Internet! My name is David Mills and I am a soon-to-be graduate of Forsyth Technical Community College. I am anticipating that by the end of this summer of 2019 I will have an Associate's degree in Information Technology â€” Programming and Software Development.</p>
	  <p>Something that people may not know about me is that I am an avid music fan. Unlike most people who claim the same, I was not always someone who enjoyed music. I grew up in a home where both of my parents were pastors. For the lucky 99% of you who did not have parents who were both pastors, allow me to explain.</p>
	  <p>Music was not something I was exposed to as heavily as others. We spent a majority of time in the car listening to an audio Bible or other pastors' teachings. From what little music I did get a glimpse of, it was always hymns or contemporary Christian music.</p>
	  <p>As I grew older, I found that there was a whole world of music out there. I quickly rebelled from the contemporary Christian scene and listened to grunge and alternative music of the '90s. Moving from there I have now grown an appreciation for a wide variety of music, ranging from classical to country and everything in between. I have even recorded several songs as I grew into my appreciation of the depth of music.</p>
<p>This entire site is dedicated to the learned passion I developed for music as a whole. Nothing compares to the feeling of creating something from nothing artistically. I absolutely love programming in the same way I love music, in this regard. At first, there is a blank page before you. After hours of hard work and dedication, the page transforms into potentially thousands of lines of code to make an application. In music, the air is the canvas. After hours of hard work and dedication, the silence is transformed into a song which can change the emotions of others, too. It's amazing.</p>
<p>So, take a journey with me. Let's discuss our successes and failures, discoveries and letdowns, together.</p>
