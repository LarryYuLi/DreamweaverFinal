      <h3>How Simple Panning Makes a Large Difference</h3>

      <p>In the past, recording music was something best kept for a studio with a producer. Nowadays there is an ever-increasing amount of bands, singers, and songwriters who use amateur equipment, looking to cut the costs of paying a producer and their studio. Personally, I have dabbled in such things for a few years myself and I have learned a great many things from it.</p>
      <p>One of the most important, yet simple, techniques I have found for maximizing loudness, increasing depth, and improving the quality of a backing track is panning. I have seen (or heard, rather) a great number of artists failing to use this trick despite its simplicity.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is record your backing track twice and pan each track on opposite sides. The depth of the pan is totally up to your song and your style. For chug-heavy metal riffs it dramatically increases the intensity without overbearing on the lead vocals. Some groups actually use the technique on the vocals themselves to emphasize certain phrases or verses.</p>
      <p>Below is an example of something I wrote earlier just to demonstrate how a little bit of panning can really change things up. I recommend listening with headphones to get the complete feel of the changes.</p>

<p>As you can hopefully tell, a little panning goes a long way! Of course, there is nothing wrong with stylistically choosing to keep everything centered, but there is a lot to gain from doubling-up on backing tracks.</p>
	  <p>There are plenty of other issues with those tracks other than just panning, as you can probably tell. Noise reduction is needed and some equalization and other effects could be used to help amplify the mood generated by the tracks. But as for adding a fair amount of depth to a track without working too hard, I can’t say it enough — a little panning goes a long way.</p>
